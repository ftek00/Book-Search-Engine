# Book-Search-Engine

## Description

```md
Book-Search-Engine is a web application that allows users to search for books using the Google Books API. The app provides an intuitive interface for discovering books by title, author, or keyword. Users can view detailed information about each book, including the title, author, description, cover image, and a link to the book's page on Google Books.

Key features of the app include:

- Search Functionality: Users can search for books and see relevant results with detailed book information.
- User Authentication: Users can sign up and log in to create a personal account.
- Saved Books: Logged-in users can save books to their account for future reference and view/manage their saved list.
- Book Management: Users can remove books from their saved list as needed.
- Session Management: The app provides session-based login/logout functionality with the option to persist saved books across sessions.

This application uses a combination of React for the front-end, with user authentication and state management, and integrates with the Google Books API to fetch book data. It is designed to be a simple and efficient way to discover, save, and organize books in a personal library.
